What is your understanding of a DevOps Culture in an Organization ( Explain in not less than 300 words ) 

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market. - (Amazon Web Services)

DevOps cultural philosophy 

Judging from the definition of DevOps, it entails cultural philosophy. Now lets elaborate on this philosophies against DevOps as a whole. Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset. At its simplest, DevOps is about removing the barriers between two traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. I n some organizations we may find no barriers between the development and operations team; engineers may both.

DevOps culture involves closer collaboration and a shared responsibility between development and operations for the products they create and maintain. This helps an organization align their people, processes, and tools toward a more unified customer focus.

It involves cultivating multidisciplinary teams who take accountability for the entire lifecycle of a product. DevOps teams work autonomously and embrace a software engineering culture, workflow, and toolset that elevates operational requirements to the same level of importance as architecture, design and development.

Being autonomous is another part DevOps culture embraces. For the development and operations teams to collaborate effectively, they need to make decisions and implement changes without a cumbersome and lengthy approval process.

A DevOps team culture values fast feedback that can help with continuous improvement of a unified development and operations team. 

Automation is also essential to DevOps culture, since it allows great collaboration and frees up resources. Automating and integrating the processes between software development and IT teams helps them to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.
