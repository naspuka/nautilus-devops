The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:

Requirement analysis
Planning
Software design such as architectural design
Software development
Testing
Deployment

Today, we have the DevOps Life Cycle, representing the SDLC and our goals to continuously deliver software value as a cross-functional team.
DevOps fits the whole model in its entirety. How to develop or deliver is up to you. Whatâ€™s important is knowing what is involved in the process.
