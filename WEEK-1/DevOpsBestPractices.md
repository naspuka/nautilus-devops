Best practices for DevOps implementation

1. Practice agile methodology:

Agile project management is the first prerequisite for introducing DevOps. Following the agile methodology, teams divide work into small chunks. It allows them to deliver small but incremental features fast, which lays the basis for DevOps’ continuous deployment practice

2. Continuously automate processes:

Automation accelerates the development cycle by reducing the amount of manual work. It helps you push code in production more frequently and produce consistent, reliable, and safe software.

3. Follow CI/CD best practices:

Continuous integration and deployment best practices are at the heart of the DevOps culture. Implementing them often requires the biggest investment and effort.

    Maintain a single source repository
    Automate the build process
    Make the build self-testing
    Commit to the mainline daily
    Trigger a build after every commit
    Test in a clone of the production environment
    Make fast feedback on quality available to everyone
    Make fixing broken builds a priority task

4. Choose your DevOps tools wisely:

DevOps tools represent a set of solutions that enable the collaboration of development and operations teams across development, testing, deployment, and performance monitoring. Tools may include;

    Work planning and tracking (Jira, Confluence)
    Development environment (Kubernetes, Docker)
    Source control tools (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket)
    Infrastructure provisioning IaC (Ansible, Puppet, Terraform)
    CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, CircleCI)
    Test automation, management, and orchestration (Mabl, Xray, Zephyr)
    Deployment automation (CodeDeploy, Bitbucket Pipelines)
    Performance monitoring (Appdynamics, DataDog, SumoLogic)
    Change management and problem tracking (Jira Service Desk, Opsgenie)

5. Make your software observable:

By giving preference to loosely coupled architectures, one can ease the deployment of new functionality on developers. However, this causes an additional burden on operations team, which has to monitor a complex and ever-changing system.

6. Shorten feedback loops:

DevOps strives to reduce wasted effort not only through process automation but also through information exchange between team members. It strives to facilitate feedback on people’s work efficiency and quality at all stages of the development cycle.

7. Transform culture and mindsets:

DevOps is a culture, not a role. Adopting DevOps practices requires creating an environment for cross-team communication and collaboration.
