A DevOps engineer is an IT professional who works with software developers, system operators and other production IT staff to oversee code releases and deployments. The role calls for someone who has relevant hard and soft to overcome the traditional barriers between software development teams and foster a collaborative, holistic environment.

The DevOps approach to software development aims for frequent, incremental changes to code versions, which means frequent deployment and testing regimens.

A DevOps engineer works with development staff to tackle the necessary coding and scripting to connect various application elements, such as APIs ,  and software development kits (SDKs), and integrate other components such as SQL data management or messaging tools that DevOps teams need to run the software release on OSes and production infrastructure. 

a DevOps engineer focuses on automation and maintenance in the live environment, so it's common to find job roles that underscore automation and maintenance of software products, systems and services.


DevOps Tools

The DevOps lifecycle starts with creating, storing, analyzing, and reviewing your source code. Source code management includes tasks such as version control, issue tracking, code review, packaging, and more.

1. Git: Distributed source code management and version control system
2. Jira: Issue and project tracking platform
3. SonarQube: Automated code review tool

Containerization platforms
Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that packages up the source code of an application and all its dependencies as a container image, so that it can be deployed to different environments without further configuration
4. Docker: Open-source containerization platform
5. Kubernetes: Automated container-orchestration platform

CI/CD and deployment tools
CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment. Continuous integration is a software development practice that merges the work of all developers working on the same project, while continuous delivery ensures reliable and frequent releases.
6. Jenkins: Open-source automated CI/CD server
7. Bamboo: Commercial automated CI/CD server
8. Octopus Deploy: Automated deployment and release management platform

Configuration management tools
Configuration management tools speed up deployment by automating the maintenance, configuration, and orchestration processes of your entire infrastructure.
9. Puppet Enterprise: A platform-independent configuration management platform
10. Ansible: A YAML-based configuration management tool

Cloud DevOps tools
These days, it’s possible to run your entire DevOps stack in the cloud, using the managed DevOps solutions of cloud service providers.
11. Azure DevOps Services: Microsoft’s cloud-based integrated DevOps platform
12. AWS DevOps: Amazon’s cloud-based DevOps toolkit

Monitoring and error reporting platforms
The last stage of the DevOps cycle is monitoring your application and infrastructure in real-time, so that you can react quickly when anything goes wrong.
13. Nagios: Infrastructure monitoring system
14. Raygun: Error monitoring and crash reporting platform
