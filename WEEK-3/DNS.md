DNS

An application layer protocol defines how the application processes running on different systems, pass the messages to each other.

    DNS stands for Domain Name System.
    DNS is a directory service that provides a mapping between the name of a host on the network and its numerical address.
    DNS is required for the functioning of the internet.
    Each node in a tree has a domain name, and a full domain name is a sequence of symbols specified by dots.
    DNS is a service that translates the domain name into IP addresses. This allows the users of networks to utilize user-friendly names when looking for other hosts instead of remembering the IP addresses.


DNS is a TCP/IP protocol used on different platforms. The domain name space is divided into three different sections: generic domains, country domains, and inverse domain.
