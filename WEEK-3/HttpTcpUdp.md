HTTP

    HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
    It is a protocol used to access the data on the World Wide Web (www).
    The HTTP protocol can be used to transfer the data in the form of plain text, hypertext, audio, video, and so on.
    This protocol is known as HyperText Transfer Protocol because of its efficiency that allows us to use in a hypertext environment where there are rapid jumps from one document to another document.
    HTTP is similar to the FTP as it also transfers the files from one host to another host. But, HTTP is simpler than FTP as HTTP uses only one connection, i.e., no control connection to transfer the files.
    HTTP is used to carry the data in the form of MIME-like format.
    HTTP is similar to SMTP as the data is transferred between client and server. The HTTP differs from the SMTP in the way the messages are sent from the client to the server and from server to the client. SMTP messages are stored and forwarded while HTTP messages are delivered immediately.


What is UDP?

The UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. Its working is similar to the TCP as it is also used for sending and receiving the message. The main difference is that UDP is a connectionless protocol. Here, connectionless means that no connection establishes prior to communication. It also does not guarantee the delivery of data packets. It does not even care whether the data has been received on the receiver's end or not, so it is also known as the "fire-and-forget" protocol. 

TCP

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a transport layer protocol that facilitates the transmission of packets from source to destination. It is a connection-oriented protocol that means it establishes the connection prior to the communication that occurs between the computing devices in a network. This protocol is used with an IP protocol, so together, they are referred to as a TCP/IP.
