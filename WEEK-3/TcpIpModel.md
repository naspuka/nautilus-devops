What are IP & TCP?

The Internet Protocol (IP) is the address system of the Internet and has the core function of delivering packets of information from a source device to a target device. IP is the primary way in which network connections are made, and it establishes the basis of the Internet. IP does not handle packet ordering or error checking. Such functionality requires another protocol, typically TCP.

TCP

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a transport layer protocol that facilitates the transmission of packets from source to destination. It is a connection-oriented protocol that means it establishes the connection prior to the communication that occurs between the computing devices in a network

TCP/IP model

    The TCP/IP model was developed prior to the OSI model.
    The TCP/IP model is not exactly similar to the OSI model.
    The TCP/IP model consists of five layers: the application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer.
    The first four layers provide physical standards, network interface, internetworking, and transport functions that correspond to the first four layers of the OSI model and these four layers are represented in TCP/IP model by a single layer called the application layer.
    TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, and each of them provides specific functionality.
